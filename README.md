Vehicle Management System
Overview

This Java project demonstrates the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a vehicle management example.
Different types of vehicles are created, assigned drivers, and managed through a common superclass.

OOP Concepts Used

Abstraction – Vehicle is an abstract class

Inheritance – Car, Motorcycle, and Truck extend Vehicle

Multi-level Inheritance – ElectroCar extends Car

Polymorphism – vehicles are stored in a Vehicle[] array

Encapsulation – private fields with public methods

Association – each Vehicle is associated with a Driver

Classes

Vehicle (abstract superclass)

Car, Motorcycle, Truck (subclasses of Vehicle)

ElectroCar (subclass of Car)

Driver

Main (program entry point)

How It Works

Vehicles are created with specific properties

Drivers are assigned to vehicles

Each vehicle can start and stop its engine

Vehicle and driver information is displayed using polymorphism

How to Run

Open the project in any Java IDE

Run Main.java

View the output in the console

Purpose

This project was created for educational purposes to practice Java OOP principles and class relationships.
